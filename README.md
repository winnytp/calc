# Calculator

Simple calculator app written in plain Javascript [(view demo)](https://winnytp.github.io/calculator/).

## Languages

This app was made using the following languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS

## Issues

Outstanding issues that have yet to be fixed:

1. Operations with large values (or lots of decimals) will overflow the calculator screen.
2. Inputting a empty decimal (e.g "3.0") will write that value to screen. Really, it should round to "3", not "3.0".
3. Javascript rounding is sometimes a bit, off... You'll see this if you use floating point operations.
